#Chinese room argument in the era of non-symbolic AI

Today artificial intelligence represents an inescapable presence, from chatbots to virtual assistants, it has established itself as the dominant feature of the 2020s. More than ever it is necessary to ask one of the questions that stimulated the curiosity of the founding fathers of the discipline: "Can machines think?". One of the most important names related to this question is that of John Searle, his thought experiment commonly called "Chinese Room Argument" still represents a milestone in the academic debate on the topic. This paper aims to verify the validity of the aforementioned thought experiment in relation to the current state of technology, in particular, it aims to verify the idea that the semantic content of mental processes cannot be replicated by formal systems, it will try to demonstrate how in some conditions semantics is an emergent property. The analysis will be based in particular on the use of computational paradigms commonly labeled as non-symbolic with examples taken from models specialized in image classification and natural language processing.
